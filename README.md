# VirTuex
Android and Web based Virtual Trial Room
## Introduction



One of the major concerns faced in online shopping is that the customers cannot try the clothes and see how that particular clothing item would look on them and hence, need to make returns. 


**57% of retailers said that dealing with returns has a negative impact on the day-to-day running of their business.**


**33% of online retailers offer free returns but offset the cost of this by charging for delivery.**


VirTuex is intended to deliver a user experience that would provide the users some ease while shopping online, by saving them from the hassles of returns/exchanges.

It is an application that can be used by people to help them try on clothes virtually they wish to buy.  It helps people to make a sure assumption about how they will look into the clothes they wish to buy on any online shopping portal just by the help of their daily drivers like laptop or mobile phones. Whenever people want to try the clothes they can go to the application, select the clothes and magically they are wearing those clothes (virtually). The clothes get superimposed on the appropriate part of the body of the user into their deviceâ€™s screen just by using the built-in device camera. The user does not require any external hardware and they can use it by a tap/click on their screen.

## Methodology


Computer Vision is being applied in the application to-


1) Detect a human face through the use of an already existing Haar Cascades Classifier.


2) Superimpose the selected outfit onto the body of the user using the coordinates obtained after successful detection.
